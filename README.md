# OGC Faster Directions

OGC's process for Standardization has evolved over a 30+ year period to be responsive to geospatial and IT trends while still retaining transparency in process and in achieving consensus. That being said, the process is never perfect!

Interested parties are encouraged to submit [Issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/faster-directions/issues) to this repository with ideas for how OGC can further improve the efficiency and visibility of the Standardization process.

Please note that faster is not always better, so there is no intent to minimize member contributions to OGC work. Rather, some aspects of the overall process could probably use some improvement, so let us know!
